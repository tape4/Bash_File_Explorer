# 🗂️ Bash File Explorer

A terminal-based file explorer built entirely with Bash.  
This project simulates a lightweight file manager inside the shell, featuring real-time navigation, categorized file listings, and a visual tree structure—all without external libraries like `ncurses`.

## 📌 Features

- 📁 **Directory Tree Rendering**  
  Visually displays the directory structure using ASCII characters.

- 🎨 **Color-coded File Categories**  
  - Executables, directories, and other files are grouped and styled differently using ANSI escape codes.

- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation**  
  - Cursor-based movement using arrow-like logic (within 20 items max per screen).

- 🛠️ **File Generator Script**  
  - `CFileMake.sh` creates a mock directory and file structure for testing.
